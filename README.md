# HELLO WORLD!

Welcome to my first attempt in creating my personal website. I hope you enjoy it!

The site is based on an amazing template you can freely download [here](https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/). Although I've also found some other cool templates available for free from [Jekyll templates](https://jekyllthemes.io/)

This is a work in progress so bear with me as I continue to improve it. In the mean time, you can check out this [detailed tutorial](https://workwithcarolyn.com/blog/digital-cv-guide) on how to build your own resume on Github.

You can have a look at this website [here](https://xacfran.github.io/Francisco-X-Castellanos/)!
